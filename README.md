# imt3673-podcast-manager
Project for IMT3673 Mobile Development

## Project Description
The idea is to create a native Android app where the user can add RSS or Atom feeds containing podcasts with audio files. These will be saved and shown in the main drawer menu of the app. The feeds will be synced and the user can listen to episodes by clicking on them. The user can also choose to download audio files to the local storage and listen to them when there is no internet avilable. It is possible for users to diplay podcasts subscribed to by other users, and post comments and rate podcasts by quality. These feeds can be sorted by the user according to popularity and rating, and can easily be added to his list. The user must register a username and password and authenticate via Firebase and his URLs to podcasts will be saved in the real-time database, along with other data such as settings, ratings and comments.
